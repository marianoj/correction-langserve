**Step 1: Start a New Project**
When the user clicks on “Start New Project,” a chat interface will start, presenting the user with a few options for chat starters. Here’s how the workflow will be structured:

1.	User Action: User clicks “Start New Project.”
2.	Interaction Initiated: The chat interface starts.
3.	Initial Questions: The system asks the user a series of questions to gather necessary project details (e.g., project name, description, target market, primary goals).

Defining Required Information for Project Initialization
Required Information:

1.	Project Name: "What is the name of your project?"
2.	Project Description: "Can you describe your project in detail?"
3.	Target Market:  "Who is your target market?"
4.	Primary Goals: "What are the primary goals of your project?"
5.	Product Ideas: "What product ideas do you have in mind?"
6.	Production Location: "Where do you plan to produce your product?"
7.	Production Costs: "What are the estimated production costs?"
8.	Timeline: "What is the expected timeline for production?"
9.	Competitor Analysis: "Can you provide a competitor analysis?"
10.	Target Audience: "Who is your target audience?"
11.	Brand Name: "What is the brand name?"
12.	Brand Values and Mission: "What are the brand values and mission?"
13.	Marketing Strategy: "What is your marketing strategy?"
14.	Operational Costs: "What are the operational costs?"
15.	Licensing and Regulations: "Are there any licensing or regulatory requirements?"

2.	Capture User Responses Function
3.	Interaction Workflow

Next Steps
1.	Confirm Initial Questions: Are these the right questions to gather the necessary information for the project?
2.	Confirm Interaction Workflow: Is the workflow for capturing user responses and starting the project correct?

Capture User Responses

**Step 2: Generate Initial Tasks Using LLM**
Next, we will use an LLM to generate initial tasks based on the information provided about the project. The tasks will be dynamically generated based on the project’s scope and requirements.

1.	Generate Tasks: The LLM generates a list of initial tasks required for the project based on the gathered project details.
2.	Present Tasks to User: The generated tasks are presented to the user for review and adjustment.

**Step 3: Determine Tools Needed for Tasks**
1.	Analyze Tasks for Tool Requirements: For each task, analyze the requirements to determine the necessary tools
2.	Check Tool Availability: Verify if the required tools are available in the system.
3.	Create Missing Tools: If a tool is not available, use the LLM to generate code for the tool or define the requirements for manual creation.

**Step 4: Create Assistants and Assign Tools**
Before we assign tasks to assistants and execute them, we need to ensure that the appropriate assistants are created and that the necessary tools for each task and assistant are defined.

1.	Define Assistants and Their Roles
2.	Create Assistants
3.	Define Tools for Each Task and Assistant

**Step 5: Present Tasks to User for Confirmation and Adjustment**
After generating the initial tasks using the LLM, the next step involves human review and adjustment. This ensures that the tasks are relevant and accurate before moving forward with assignment and execution.

1.	Present Generated Tasks to the User
2.	User Reviews and Adjusts Tasks
3.	Save Finalized Tasks

**Step 6: Mapping Tasks to Database Fields**
To efficiently manage and store all the necessary information for your project, we need to define a set of database fields. These fields will help in organizing tasks, tracking progress, and ensuring all aspects of the project are covered.

**Step 7: Assign and Execute Tasks**
1.	Assign Tasks to Assistants: The tasks are assigned to the appropriate assistants.
2.	Execute Tasks: The tasks are executed by the assistants, and their status is updated accordingly.

**Step 8: Tasks Completion and Human Review**
1. Task Completion Notification: Once a task is completed, the user (human) is notified that a task is ready for review. All tasks awaiting review are listed in a dedicated section in the app.
2. Human Review and Approval: Review Task Details: The user can click on a task to view its details then Approve or Request Changes. If changes are requested, the task is sent back to the assistant with feedback.
3. Task Feedback and Iteration: If the user requests changes, they provide specific feedback on what needs to be improved or adjusted. The assistant revises the task based on the feedback and resubmits it for review. The process repeats until the user approves the task.

**Step 9: Tasks Completion and Human Review**
When a task is completed and approved, the relevant information should be stored in a structured format in the database. Each task type will have specific fields that need to be populated.
